Howdy.

- üå± Keep learning. Keep going. Keep growing.
- üìù Writing low-level code is fun. Worrying about hardware going EOL is not.
- üíé Tech needs to be open-source for it to really shine. That's every single one of my projects has its source available to the public.

## My projects

### **[In progress]** [Titanium-49](https://github.com/ardent-development/Titanium-49)

A hardware device based on the Raspberry Pi Pico that allows one to capture screenshots of and remotely control their TI-89 Titanium graphing calculator from their PC. Exposes a well-documented serial-over-USB interface that web-based and native apps alike can link with. Completely open-source, written in Python, and can easily be built at home from parts and a breadboard.


### **[In progress]** [CycleGen](https://github.com/ardent-development/CycleGen)

A user-friendly, customizable BASIC script for the TI-89 Titanium graphing calculator that enables one to produce smooth animations of graphs. It can do things that Desmos can't, like algebraic operations on variables on a per-frame basis. Extremely powerful due to its infinite flexibility and granting of total power to the user.


### [Clicker](https://github.com/ardent-development/Clicker)

A high-performance recursive function executor for the TI-89 Titanium. Its main selling point is the fact that one need not fill up their home screen with intermediate garbage when wanting to execute a recursive function many times. Built to be as fast as the TI-BASIC interpreter can make it while also offering a couple of QoL features.


### **[In progress]** [a5x5](https://github.com/ardent-development/a5x5)

A variable-width raster font designed for use on systems with extremely low resolution and pixel density.
