Howdy.

- 🔭 I wonder if aliens exist... 🤔
- 📖 I am reading lots of technical books which I never finish.
- 🌱 Keep learning. Keep going. Keep growing.
- 📝 I'm learning RP2040 (ARM Cortex-M0+) assembly, and honestly it's easier than I expected.
- 💢 I believe that all technology should be open-source and patent-free if we really want to take advantage of our potential. But instead we continue designing new internal combustion engines in nonfree CAD software running on cryptically designed chips in closed-source computers that hum along next to black-box phones we don't even know if we can trust.
- 🦠 Help scientists fight disastrous diseases by [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/). [Here's my profile](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/name/HackerDaGreat57). (I was not paid to put this here)
- ⚡ Fun (actually pretty sad) fact: I don't get any allowance 😔
- 🎵 Favorite artist: [helloworld](https://open.spotify.com/artist/01qG5pbsKe96w87ZMjphP4) (I was not paid to put this here)

I know a *bit* of Bash and C++. I also know what I think is a lot about mid-high level computer architecture, but there is still a lot for me to learn. I used to know Batchfile, but I am extremely rusty since I haven't needed to use it in a long while.

I also develop for dying platforms like the TI-89 Titanium, for which I am creating a few math and utility programs. It pains me to see how much potential TI wasted on this thing.
