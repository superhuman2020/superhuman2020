Howdy.

- 🌱 Keep learning. Keep going. Keep growing.
- 📝 Writing low-level code is fun. Worrying about hardware going EOL is not.
- 💎 Tech needs to be open-source for it to really shine. That's every single one of my projects has its source available to the public.

### My projects

 - [CycleGen](https://github.com/ardent-development/CycleGen): a user-friendly customizable BASIC script for the TI-89 Titanium graphing calculator that enables one to produce smooth animations of graphs. It can do things that Desmos can't, like algebraic operations on variables on a per-frame basis.
 - [Clicker](https://github.com/ardent-development/Clicker): yet another BASIC script for the TI-89 Titanium that enables one to recursively execute a single-variable function without the inconvenience of filling their home screen with temporary garbage.
 - **[In progress]** [a5x5](https://github.com/ardent-development/a5x5): A variable-width raster font designed for use on systems with extremely low resolution and pixel density.
