Howdy.

- 🔭 I wonder if aliens exist... 🤔
- 📖 I am reading lots of technical books which I never finish.
- 🌱 Keep learning. Keep going. Keep growing.
- 📝 I'm learning RP2040 (ARM Cortex-M0+) assembly, and honestly it's easier than I expected.
- 💬 I'm open for chatting about pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: `twisted.nematic57@gmail.com` or `twisted_nematic57` on Discord
- 💢 Why is so much of today's software so inefficient? Is there really no better way to get things done??
- 🦠 Help scientists fight disastrous diseases by [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/). [Here's my profile](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/name/HackerDaGreat57). (I was not paid to put this here)
- ⚡ Fun (actually pretty sad) fact: I don't get any allowance 😔
- 🎵 Favorite artist: [helloworld](https://open.spotify.com/artist/01qG5pbsKe96w87ZMjphP4) (I was not paid to put this here)

I know a *bit* of Bash and C++. I also know what I think is a lot about mid-high level computer architecture, but there is still a lot for me to learn. I used to know Batchfile, but then I moved on from Windows, and honestly you should too.
